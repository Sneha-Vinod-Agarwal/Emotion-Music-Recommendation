# Emotion-Music-Recommendation
This project uses an emotion recognition model trained on the FER-2013 dataset to detect seven emotions from a live webcam feed. Based on the predicted emotion, it fetches playlists from Spotify via the Spotipy wrapper and displays personalized song recommendations in real time.
